## Schwarzschild Black Hole OBJ File Generation
Given metric description by
$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2M}{r}\right) dt^2
       + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2M}{r}}
       + r^2 d\Omega^2
$$
, we should be able to generate an OBJ file for visualizing the geometry of Schwarzschild case.

### Toy Model for Sphere
A square can be separated into two triangles, by labeling the vertices carefully, we are capable of doing successive actions to build a sphere containing infinite triangles.
